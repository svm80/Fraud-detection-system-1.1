# Fraud Detection Project

This project implements a fraud detection system using a dataset of credit card transactions. The objective is to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate using a Logistic Regression model.

## Project Structure
- **code**: Contains the Python script (`fraud_detection.py`) that loads the dataset, preprocesses data, trains the model, and evaluates its performance.
- **data**: Place the dataset file (`creditcard.csv`) here.
- **documentation**: Additional project documentation.

## Steps to Run the Project
1. Place the dataset file (`creditcard.csv`) in the `data` folder.
2. Run the `fraud_detection.py` script in the `code` folder to execute the fraud detection model.

## Dependencies
Install the necessary Python libraries using:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Model Evaluation
The model uses accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to evaluate performance.
